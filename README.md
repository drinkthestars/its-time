## :scroll: Description
A "minimal" timer that displays 3 colored rings to indicate the progress of seconds, hours, and minutes, from the outside-in.
The timer can be paused & reset. While paused, the timer's time units can be updated.

In the center of the timer, a 3D projected cube appears and rotates as the timer progresses.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Explores animation/state choreography and Canvas drawing APIs in Compose. The rotating cube is an exercise in
3D -> 2D projection mechanics, inspired by [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Iz0XJY-Qk&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) Processing 3 tutorials.

Timer design inspired by a couple of designs on Dribbble such as [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/5717098-Daily-UI-Design-Challenge-014-Countdown-Timer) and [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/5115846-Daily-UI-014-Countdown-Timer)
